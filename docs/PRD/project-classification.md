# Project Classification

**Technical Type:** Scientific Computing + Developer Tool (Research Validation Framework)
**Domain:** Academic Research / Distributed Systems
**Complexity:** Medium-High

This project sits at the intersection of scientific computing (protocol simulation, empirical validation, statistical analysis) and developer tooling (extensible framework, pluggable components, research infrastructure). The domain complexity stems from Byzantine Agreement theory, distributed systems validation requirements, and the need to translate formal proofs into executable code with provable correctness properties.
