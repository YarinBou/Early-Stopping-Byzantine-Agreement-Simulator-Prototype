# The Magic Woven Throughout

**This PRD captures the essence of proving elegant theory works in messy reality.**

Every requirement traces back to the three primary research questions:
1. Does early-stopping achieve (1+ε)f in practice? → *Round tracking, statistical validation, theoretical curve overlay*
2. Is it meaningfully faster than classical BA? → *Perry-Toueg baseline, direct comparison, 2-5× improvement target*
3. Does correctness hold under adversaries? → *Always-on assertions, zero violation requirement, comprehensive adversary suite*

The magic moment this system creates:
- **Visual Validation**: Watching the early-stopping curve visibly beat classical on the first clean plot
- **Safety Under Fire**: Zero Agreement violations across all adversarial stress tests
- **Lasting Contribution**: When future researchers build on this instead of starting from scratch

Success means more than a thesis defense—it means creating a **trustworthy, modular, runnable Byzantine Agreement laboratory** that accelerates the path from theoretical innovation to practical validation.
