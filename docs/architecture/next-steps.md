# Next Steps

## Immediate: Begin Implementation

**First story:** Story 1.1 (Project Structure & Dependencies)
- Create directory structure
- Set up requirements.txt
- Initialize Git repository
- Write README quickstart

**First week focus:** Epic 1 (Foundation Infrastructure)
- Stories 1.1-1.9 establish message handling
- Can parallelize: 1.2 + 1.4, then 1.6-1.8

**Critical path milestones:**
- Week 4: Foundation + Round Scheduler complete
- Week 8: All protocol FSMs operational
- Week 11: BA Controller with early-stopping working on n=7
- Week 13: Adversaries + Evidence store complete
- Week 14: Classical baseline operational
- Week 18: Full experimental campaign complete

## Documentation Tasks

1. **Protocol Specification** (during Epic 3-4)
   - Detailed CoD, GDA, PoP phase descriptions
   - Threshold logic mathematical proofs
   - Message flow diagrams

2. **Research Methodology** (during Epic 8)
   - Statistical analysis approach
   - Confidence interval computation
   - Experimental design rationale

3. **README.md** (Story 1.1)
   - Quickstart in < 5 minutes
   - Installation instructions
   - First experiment execution

**Architecture Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND VALIDATED

**Ready for:** Implementation (Story 1.1)

**Reference:** All agents implementing stories MUST follow this architecture exactly.

_This architecture document was created through collaborative decision-making between Yarin and the Architect agent, transforming PRD requirements into a complete technical blueprint ready for multi-agent implementation._

**Architecture Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Next Workflow:** Begin Story 1.1 (Project Structure & Dependencies)
